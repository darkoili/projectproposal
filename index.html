<h1>Darko Ilic's final project proposal</h1>
<p>Working name: OOTD Maker</p>
<p>Team members: Just me. </p>
<p> My website would basically offer a quiz in where you are asked to pick between certain fashion style choices and 
then based on your answers you will have a complete outfit generated to meet your needs. The user will be prompted to answer
whether or not they love or hate a certain outfit that is displayed in picture format and then their generated outfit will be displayed also as a picture.</p>
<p> I will mainly use html, css, and javascript in order to execute my program and will host my repository through github pages.</p>
<p> Current features would include a nice looking interface and personal quiz. Once the quiz is complete, it will disappear and display the complete outfit suggestion based on your quiz preferences
 consisting of a base, bottom, layer, outwear, and accessory pieces.</p>
<p> Four features that are of similar complexity to features that I delivered in previous applications include, 1. A CSS styled webpage that includes different color text and background (Hello World). 2. A webpage that includes multiple buttons that when clicked pursue a specific function(Getting to Know each other enhanced). 3. A HTML quiz format with specific answer options (MatchMaker). 4.The implemnation of external image files in a HTML webpage (getting to know each other) 

 <p> </p>Two features that are of greater complexity to that of which I learned in class are: 1. How to combine, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to have a start button that once pressed displays the rest of my webpage and fades the webpage in upon the clicking of the start button. 2. Greater complexity javascript that will display a generated outfit image and format text upon the clicking of another button, and repeat this multiple times for each outfit suggestion.
<p> Future features may include the option for all your outfit pieces to have links directing you to another resposity in where you can purchase those goods. </p>
<p> Basic techincal features will include the use of consistent coding standards and the use of javascript functions to run a quiz and offer an output from the quiz.
  Other features will include the heavy use of CSS to make a nice looking interface</p>
<p> Advanced techincal features may include the option to digitally try on your generated outfit using a 3D camera.  </p>
