<h1>Darko Ilic's final project proposal</h1>
<p>Working name: Men's style quiz.</p>
<p>Team members: Just me. </p>
<p> My website would basically offer a quiz in where you are asked to pick between certain fashion style choices and 
then based on your answers you will have a complete outfit generated to meet your needs.  </p>
<p> I will mainly use html, css, and javascript in order to execute my program and will host my repository through github pages.</p>
<p> Current features eatures would include a nice looking interface and personal quiz. Once the quiz is complete it will disappear and display the complete outfit suggestion based on your quiz prefernces
 consisting of a base, bottom, layer, outwear, and accessory.</p>
<p> Future features may include the option for all your outfit pieces to have links directing you to another resposity in where you can purchase those goods. </p>
<p> Basic techincal features will include the use of consistent coding standards and the use of javascript functions to run a quiz and offer an output from the quiz.
  Other features will include the heavy use of CSS to make a nice looking interface</p>
<p> Advanced techincal features may include the option to press on images of stlyes the user likes and from this input generate a outfit suggestion.  </p>
